## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name="project_motivation"></a>
My motivation for this project was to complete the 'Write a Data Science Blog Post' for the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.  For this project I was interested in looking at TMDb (The Movie Database) data to better understand:
1. What are the top movies by popularity?
2. What are the top movies by revenue?
3. Is there any correlation between popularity and revenue or voting average?
4. What are the longest and shortest movie runtimes?
6. Does runtime or affect the popularity of a movie?

## File Descriptions <a name="file_descriptions"></a>
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (TMDb_Movie_Exploration.ipynb) that showcases the work related to the above questions. The notebook is an exploratory analysis of the data to answer the questions above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The file tmdb_movies_data.csv contains information on over 10,000 movies obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/juzershakir/tmdb-movies-dataset).

## Findings <a name="findings"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgments <a name="licensing"></a>
Must give credit to TMDb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
